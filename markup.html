            <br>I sheltered you from <strong>harm</strong>
            <br>I gave you hugs so <em>warm</em>
            <br>I thought all of this was <em>magic</em> 
            <br>Suddenly it becomes <strong>tragic</strong>   
            <br><br>I know it's not easy, it's not <strong>fun</strong>   
            <br>But thank you for being the <strong>one</strong>,
            <br>The one that makes me <em>smile</em>
            <br>Even if itâ€™s for a while.
